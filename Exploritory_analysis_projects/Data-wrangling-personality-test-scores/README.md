## Data Wrangling

From the snapshot of our data, we can see we have some missing values, mainly from the 'Unnamed' columns.We dropped empty columns, to make the data cleaner and easier to work with.

We have separated the scores of each individual into the 5 personality subscales (Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Neuroticism, and Imagination), these will help us rapidly identify 'high risk' individuals, who may not be best suited for the work environment.

We have inputted the relevant department to each individual to have more data points on each individual, while ensuring that the department names all have the same spelling, ie. lowercases. With this snapshot of the data, we can quickly identify whether an individual is at high risk or not.

Therefore, we found that there are two high-risk individuals, 1 in data science and another in copywriting. Otherwise, most of the individuals who have taken the test seem to be low risk and are therefore eligible for work.There are two high-risk individuals in this data set, these are people who may not be best suited for the work environment, people who score less than 30 on agreeableness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism.

## Conclusion

There are two high-risk individuals in this data set, these are people who may not be best suited for the work environment, people who score less than 30 on agreeableness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism.
